/**
 * The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of
 * control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features
 * can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for
 * building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.
 *
 * Bean is simple class which is annotated just to denote to Spring that it should
 * be inserted in the object graph in container/context.
 *
 * @ComponentScan means that all components in this package should be translated
 * in beans.
 *
 * @Component (and @Service and @Repository) are used to auto-detect and auto-configure
 * beans using classpath scanning. There's an implicit one-to-one mapping between the
 * annotated class and the bean (i.e. one bean per class).
 * As long as these classes are in under our base package or Spring is aware
 * of another package to scan, a new bean will be created for each of these classes.
 *
 * @Bean is used to explicitly declare a single bean, rather than letting Spring do it
 * automatically as above. It decouples the declaration of the bean from the class definition,
 * and lets you create and configure beans exactly how you choose.
 * With @Bean you arenâ€™t placing this annotation at the class level.
 * If you tried to do that you would get an invalid type error.
 * Typically, @Bean methods are declared within @Configuration classes.
 *
 * So if we use default constructor of we have a constructor which dependencies
 * are beans then we don't have to work with configuration
